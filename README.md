JS-3dRE is a rendering engine made in Javascript and HTMl. X, Y, and Z coordinates are stored as points and drawn with JS.

_If you are contributing on a chromebook, you can debug at this link: https://collinthepope.github.io/JS-3dRE/
before debugging, deploy the latest version of your code to the test branch and deploy the github page. Because of the nature of school chromebooks, these steps are required._
